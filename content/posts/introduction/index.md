The real AI gap isn’t model quality — it’s extraction depth.
Top builders can extract **10,000x** value, while most teams only get **5x**.
That gap is where the biggest opportunities live.

## 1) Why people disagree so much about AI

The split in AI opinions often comes from one thing: **how deeply someone can extract capability**.

Some builders feel we are “3 steps from AGI.” Others feel we are “7 steps away.”
That 4-step perception gap is not academic — it’s commercial.

We were too quick to say, “AI can’t do this,” when in many cases we simply hadn’t pushed hard enough.

## 2) In the AI era, there are three paths — with wildly different upside

### Path 1: Use AI for efficiency (most conservative)

Improve existing workflows, reduce labor, speed up execution.
Useful, but the upside is limited. Traditional companies are often strong here.

### Path 2: Build with new AI tech itself (startups can have a 10x edge)

Large companies face real constraints: org silos, internal politics, and “must-use-our-own-model” mandates.
Products like **OpenClaw** and **YouMind** — which connect across models instead of locking into one — show why startups can move faster.

### Path 3: Build AI-native products (largest upside)

Not just “using a car to transport grain faster,” but creating a brand-new category.
Look for products that **cannot exist without AI**.

This requires strong foresight, the kind seen in people like Bill Gates and Allen Zhang.

## 3) Learn from Peter Steinberger: how to unlock 10,000x

The performance gap is staggering:

- Default workflows: often **1.2x to 5x**
- Top builders: up to **10,000x** (e.g. hundreds of commits in a day)

The key is not longer prompts.
It’s:

- Multi-step workflows
- Unix philosophy
- Command-line automation
- Strong architecture and testing discipline

LLMs are still weak at repeated iterative patching.
You get better outcomes with **one-shot generation + smart process design**.

## Action plan

1. Study how Peter actually works, in detail.
2. Avoid “wandering exploration.” Pick a concrete goal and ship something real.
3. Prioritize **task-oriented products** over taste-oriented products when trying to extract AI capability.
